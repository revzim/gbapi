## Disclaimer
* When signing up, I advise to not use serious emails/pwds. This is meant to be a simple example of using mongodb/golang for cloud saves with [GBA CLOUDSAVES APP](https://github.com/revzim/azgba)
* There is no system implemented for salting&hashing passwords, so this is not a very safe approach as I was not very worried about security when creating this.
